# Screenshots

This directory stores marketing and documentation screenshots for TextToSpeechApp.

## Current Assets
- `tight-ass-mode.png`: placeholder image representing the new Tight Ass Mode provider. Replace this file with an actual in-app screenshot captured via `Cmd+Shift+4` once the UI is ready.

## Tips for Consistent Screenshots
1. Open TextToSpeechApp in light mode at 1280Ã—720.
2. Populate the editor with meaningful sample text.
3. Select the Tight Ass Mode provider and highlight local generation messaging.
4. Use macOS screenshot tooling (`Cmd+Shift+5`) and save as PNG.
5. Copy the file into this directory, keeping the existing filename so documentation links continue to work.
